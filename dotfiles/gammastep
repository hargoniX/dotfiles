; 0 will cause an immediate change between screen temperatures.
; 1 will gradually apply the new screen temperature over a couple of seconds.
fade=1

; Solar elevation thresholds.
; By default, Redshift will use the current elevation of the sun to determine
; whether it is daytime, night or in transition (dawn/dusk). When the sun is
; above the degrees specified with elevation-high it is considered daytime and
; below elevation-low it is considered night.
elevation-high=3
elevation-low=-6


; Set the location-provider: 'geoclue2', 'manual'.
; The location provider settings are in a different section.
location-provider=geoclue2

; Set the adjustment-method: 'randr', 'vidmode', 'drm', 'wayland'.
; 'randr' is the preferred X11 method, 'vidmode' is an older API
; that works in some cases when 'randr' does not.
; The adjustment method settings are in a different section.
adjustment-method=wayland

; Configuration of the adjustment-method
; type 'gammastep -m METHOD:help' to see the settings.
; ex: 'gammastep -m randr:help'
; In this example, randr is configured to adjust only screen 0.
; Note that the numbering starts from 0, so this is actually the first screen.
; If this option is not specified, Redshift will try to adjust _all_ screens.
